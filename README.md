# how to do localization?

If you want to **Patch** some translation error, just clone this repo, fix it, and submit a pull request, I'll do the merge thing.

If you want to make a new localization file, you can copy the x2048.ts file to x2048-locale.ts and do the translation, then submit a pull request.

# What I could offer?

Every new complete language contributor can join my *Vendor Tester* team, and can download all my apps for free.
